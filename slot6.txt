This is a **Magicka Dragonknight damage-dealer**, an offensive role with a backbar heal-over-time (HoT). One of the two-piece sets is **Vicious Death** which is a light-armor set (bought with AP in Cyrodiil) and the other is **Clever Alchemist** which is craftable. The monster set is **Grothdarr** (from an easy vet dungeon) and the build also requires the **Malacath ring** (requires the Greymoor chapter). Please contact @AGSNATURE for build details.

The three jewelry pieces need to be traited as *Harmony*.
The primary ultimate should be **Shifting Standard**.

In case that bar switching is easy and there are more DKs in group, the secondary ultimate may be **Eye**; otherwise you can double-slot Standard as it is vital for a successful push.
