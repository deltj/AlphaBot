This is a **Magicka Sorcerer support** build, an *offensive* role that focuses on streaking. The two five-piece sets are both light armor: **Curse Eater** (bought with AP in Cropsford) and **Meritorious** (bought with Telvat at IC). Also the **Snow Treaders** (a mythic item that requieres the Greymoor chapter) are needed.

The backbar weapon needs to be a *Blackrose restoration staff*

The essential ultimate is the healing morph of negate and it is actually often double barred to ensure easy access. Make sure to adjust the ground-targeting mode to automatic once you have mastered aiming your negates.

The main skills include
1) Right before engaging, reapply your *shield*. As a push is about to begin, *anticipate* the direction and  **streak** ahead of the group to stun the enemy.

2) Upon completing the streak, cast **Restraining Prison** to further stun them and to protect yourself.

3) **Purge**: use the efficient one if your magicka regeneration is giving you trouble, otherwise use cleanse.

4) **Energy Orb** that need to be cast when kiting and between pushes, but *never* offensively.

5) **Ward Ally** to be cast on the backbar restoration staff on allies who are behind and under heavy fire.
