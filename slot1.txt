This is a **Magicka Templar healer**, a strictly defensive role. The two five-piece sets (both light) are **Winter's Respite** (DLC overland set) and **Gossamer** (DLC dungeon drop set), the latter of which will change after the next DLC release.

The main ultimate is **Remembrance** and it is important to cast it *ahead of the group* and *interrupt the cast* as the group moves past your location.

The backbar ultimate is **Solar Disturbance** and it is to be used *only* when the group is in no imminent danger; this is **not** an offensive skill.

The main skills include
1) **Illustrious Healing** that needs to be recast every four seconds if using the *Master's Restoration staff*.

2) **Radiating Regeneration** that needs to be cast often enough to apply one stack on each group member.

3) **Extended Ritual** that *should not* be cast while initiating a push so as not to mask the defensive synergies.
