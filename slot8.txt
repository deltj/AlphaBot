This is a **Magicka Sorcerer support** build, a *defensive* role that focuses on purging. The two five-piece sets are both light armor:
**Curse Eater** (bought with AP in Cropsford) and **Meritorious** (bought with Telvat at IC). Also the **Snow Treaders** (a mythic item that requieres the Greymoor chapter) are needed.

The backbar weapon needs to be a *Blackrose restoration staff*

The essential ultimate is the healing morph of negate and it is actually often double barred to ensure easy access. Make sure to adjust the ground-targeting mode to automatic once you have mastered aiming your negates.

The main skills include

1) **Purge**: use the efficient one if your magicka regeneration is giving you trouble, otherwise use cleanse.

2) **Orbs** that need to be cast when kiting and between pushes, but *never* offensively.

3) **Ward Ally** to be casrt on the backbar restoration staff on allies who are behind and under heavy fire.

4) When the *offensive* sorc is momentarily unavailable, if it is safe to do so, you can also **streak**.

5) **Lightning flood** to provide a damage synergy.

6) **Radiating Regeneration** to cast before and between pushes (everyone should have multiple stacks at those times).

7) **Siege shield** for when we use a ram or the ranged siege is under heavy fire. This is also useful inside keeps when under hostile oils.
