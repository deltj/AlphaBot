This is a **Magicka Necromancer damage-dealer**, an offensive role with a backbar heal-over-time (HoT). One of the two-piece sets is **Vicious Death** which is a light-armor set (bought with AP in Cyrodiil) and the other is **Clever Alchemist** which is craftable. The monster set is **Balorgh** (vet DLC dungeon or golden vendor) and the build also requires the **Malacath ring** (requires the Greymoor chapter).

The three jewelry pieces need to be traited as *Harmony*.

The main ultimate is **Pestilent Colossus** and it needs to be places *behind* the enemy at the beginning of an engagement.

The backbar ultimate is the resurrection one; either morph will work.

The main skills include AOE damage from destruction staff and class abilities, especially

1) **Avid Boneyard** so you can synergize your own stuff instead of waiting for others to be in point.

2) **Agony Totem** to drop in your feet as we run.
