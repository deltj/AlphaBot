This is a **Magicka Templar healer** that is a completely defensive role. The first five-piece light armor set is either **Hiti** or **Hollowfang** (both are DLV dungeon drop sets) and the second one is **Transmutation** (can be bought with AP in Cyrodiil).

The main skills include

1) **Illustrious Healing** that needs to be recast every four seconds if using the *Master's Restoration staff*.

2) **Radiating Regeneration** that needs to be cast often enough to apply one stack on each group member.

3) **Extended Ritual** that *should not* be cast while initiating a push so as not to mask the defensive synergies.
