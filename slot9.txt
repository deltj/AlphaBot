This is a **Magicka Necromancer healer**, a defensive role that also provides *offensive synergies*.

The two five-piece sets (both light) are **Hollowfang** (DLC dungeon drop set) and **Olorime** (DLC trial set); the former can also be **Spell Power Cure** (IC dungeon drop set that you can also get with key fragments) after the next DLC release.

The main ultimate is the resurrection ultimate **Renewing animation** (please do not use the morph that consumes corpses) and it is important to coordinate and call out the use of this ultimate. The backbar ultimate is for situations where no group member is dead or in immediate risk of dying: "the hulk" (colossus), technically either morph can work. The main skills include
1) **Renewing Undeath** that works best when used on a corpse so as to also remove negative effects and applying a heal-over-time.

2) **Radiating Regeneration** that needs to be cast often enough to apply one stack on each group member.

3) **Unnerving Boneyard** that can be cast ahead to where the damage dealers will engage with the enemy without the need to expose the healer to the damage,

4) **Necrotic Potency** for building ultimate and slightly reducing incoming damage.

5) Optionally, also **Bone Totem** (either morph) can be used for fearing the enemy.
