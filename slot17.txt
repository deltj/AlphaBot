This is a **Magicka healer** that can be either a **Templar**, a **Nightblade**, or a **Necromancer**. This is primarily a defensive role. The two light-armor sets to be worn as five-piece sets are **Gossamer** (a DLC dungeon drop set) and **Transmutation** (can be bought in Cyrodiil with AP).

The primary ultimate depends on the class: **Remembrance** for Templars (*must* be cast preventively and then interrupted if the group moves past you), **Siphon** for Nightblades (*must* be followed by a burst heal), and the *resurrection ultimate* for Necromancers.

The secondary ultimate also depends on the class: **Solar Prison** for Templars (only to be used when the group is in no immediate danger), **Meteor** (either morph) for Nightblades, and **Colossus** for Necromancers.

The main skills include
1) **Illustrious Healing** that needs to be recast every four seconds if using the *Master's Restoration staff*.

2) **Radiating Regeneration** that needs to be cast often enough to apply one stack on each group member.

3) For Templars, **Extended Ritual** that *should not* be cast while initiating a push so as not to mask the defensive synergies.
