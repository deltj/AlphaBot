This is a **Magicka Warden damage-dealer**, an offensive role with a backbar heal-over-time (HoT). One of the two-piece sets is **Vicious Death** which is a light-armor set (bought with AP in Cyrodiil) and the other is **Clever Alchemist** which is craftable. The monster set is **Balorgh** (vet DLC dungeon or golden vendor) and the build also requires the **Malacath ring** (requires the Greymoor chapter).
